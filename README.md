CAN Gateway para evaluar la conducta de un conductor.
The growing number of smart cars worldwide has driven the development of new technologies for scanning and obtaining information. In this project, it was proposed to obtain data from a car's ECUs, such as speed values, acceleration, turn signals, pedals, and others, which can be identified through IDs.  For the development of our project, a CAN-Gateway prototype was implemented, allowing for the monitoring of information parameters through memory storage. To identify the IDs corresponding to each section, tests were conducted on a KIA car. Once the IDs and parameters to be captured were identified, a neural network was implemented to determine the type of driver (aggressive or defensive) based on the established parameters. Finally, a 3D model was developed that encompasses the electronic structure of the project, featuring an innovative design.
